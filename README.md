## Description

This project will try to look at medical images and determine whether or not they contain melanoma.
Through the use of deep learning, I will build models that try to extract features from the images
so that I can correctly classify the images.

Reproducability of results is a huge concern in the field of deep learning, so I will use docker to
ensure environmental differences between developers are kept to a minimum. There will be containers
for getting the dataset, as well as building, training and evaluating models.

Another cruicial aspect of developing models is tuning hyper parameters. It is important to change them
in a controlled way, so that you can understand which models performed better and get an intution into
how to change them in the future so that they may keep getting better.
